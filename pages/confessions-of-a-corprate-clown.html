    Sorry to break it to you, but this story is not
    about that famous clown or his famous fast food
    chain. It’s about new adventures and jumping into the
    unknown. It’s about trying to have fun and laugh
    when life gets tough. It’s about bringing a few more
    smiles into the world.
    It’s about loneliness. It’s about fear. It’s about
    freedom. It’s about who we think we are versus who
    we really are. How do we navigate through the day
    while we glue-on then peel-off mask after
    mask? Who are we dressing up for? Why the
    costumes? Why the voices? Trying to find our way
    back after losing our way is bold. Shedding skins we
    don’t need anymore is scary. Knowing we have to
    drop something in order to pick something up is
    uncomfortable. You ever try forcing yourself into a
    medium-sized shirt when you know you're a large?
    There is a childlike playfulness we all have deep
    inside of us. I truly believe that. And if yours is
    sleeping right now, I hope our show can wake it up
    today. Or at the very least, get it stirring.
