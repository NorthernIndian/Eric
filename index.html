<h3>Extensive Bio</h3>
<p>
    Eric Regimbald grew up in the small Ontario town of Guelph. There he started out making his
    own films at the age of 12. One notable 45-minute action film titled Nobody's Real, was a huge
    undertaking at a young age. Armed with a camera, some friends, and 2 weeks of summer he
    completed the action-packed, stunt-ridden film. From there he went on to study theatre in the
    arts high school program Ross Touring Players. There he would learn his craft and begin his
    foray into professional acting. With Trillium grants providing the funding, Eric with his theatre
    troupe would tour plays across Southern Ontario. These plays would carry a strong message of
    hope whilst tackling some tough subject matter: Suicide, bullying, Homophobia, etc. One such
    play A Permanent Solution went on to pair with The Suicide resource group and was put up at
    the local Playhouse: The River Run center. It then went on to be captured on film and played in
    schools and the notable Bookshelf Cinema. But it wasn't until the play went up at the Sears
    Ontario Drama Festival in 2006 that Eric would be presented his first acting award for Best Actor
    of the fest!
    This humble beginning prepared Eric for much larger pursuits. He moved to Toronto in 2007
    where he would write his first play, Just the Ticket which he produced at The Toronto Fringe
    Festival in The Annex Theatre. He would continue to study with Straeon Acting Studios while
    booking auditions, being a part of countless theatre projects and continuing to write. His
    episodic comedy web series Van Damme Motors is still being enjoyed today on Youtube with 2
    seasons!
    In 2015 he took an offer to live in Vancouver and work as a professional clown. Since then He's
    collaborated with some amazing artists. He was an invited guest at the Mathew Lillard weekend
    workshop at the Vancouver Film School. He's acted opposite Mandy Patinkin in the upcoming
    series Career Opportunities in Murder & Mayhem (Hulu) as well as shared the small screen with
    Hilary Swank in Alaska Daily (ABC). His short horror film Patty Cake (Punchback productions)
    was an official selection at the Horror Hound Festival. Eric has recently written produced and
    performed his one-man show Confessions of a Corporate clown (At the carousel theatre
    Vancouver) which he hopes to option as a film or mini-series in the near future.
